# Migration Guide

## File Info
- Original: ai-chatbot-framework/app/bot/dialogue_manager/http_client.py
- Deployment: Microservice
- Complexity: Low
- Estimated Hours: 8

## Breaking Changes
- The original synchronous module was converted into an HTTP microservice. Instead of calling call_api directly, clients must send requests to the /call endpoint.
- Entrypoint moved: previously imported module functions may need adaptation to call the running service.
- Environment variables are introduced (SERVICE_HOST, SERVICE_PORT, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, AIOHTTP_POOL_SIZE, DATABASE_URL).
- Added new dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, asyncpg, python-json-logger, prometheus_client). Update your packaging accordingly.
- The service creates a global aiohttp.ClientSession and optional asyncpg pool â€” lifecycle is managed by the app.
- APICallExcetion is preserved, but error handling now returns HTTP status codes (502 for external API failures).

## Migration Steps
1) Build and publish Docker image
   - docker build -t your-repo/http-client-microservice:latest .
   - docker push your-repo/http-client-microservice:latest

2) Kubernetes
   - Update image in kubernetes_manifest to your image
   - kubectl apply -f k8s-manifest.yaml

   Probes
   - /health is liveness; /readiness checks DB connectivity if DATABASE_URL provided.

3) ECS/Fargate via Terraform
   - Configure variables (image, region, subnets, security_groups)
   - terraform init && terraform apply

4) Environment variables
   - Provide DATABASE_URL as a secret. In Kubernetes, use Secret and mount as env var.
   - Adjust AIOHTTP_POOL_SIZE and DEFAULT_TIMEOUT based on expected concurrency.

5) Monitoring
   - If ENABLE_PROMETHEUS=true, scrape /metrics endpoint via Prometheus
   - Use the provided metrics (api_requests_total, api_request_latency_seconds, external_api_errors_total)

6) Logging
   - Logs are JSON structured. Configure your log aggregator (Fluentd/Fluent Bit/CloudWatch) to parse JSON logs.

7) Graceful shutdown
   - The app listens to SIGTERM and attempts to cancel outstanding tasks and close pools.
   - Ensure your platform sends SIGTERM then waits for graceful period (K8s terminationGracePeriodSeconds > 30 recommended).
